# About Me

I am an LLM Algorithm Engineer at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, where I joined the Recommendation and Search Laboratory in 2022 after completing my M.S. degree at Peking University. My primary focus is on enhancing large language models' capabilities in code competitions and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I have also made significant contributions to LLM4Rec (Large Language Models for Recommendation) projects.

My research interests span LLM for Recommendation, LLM for Code, RAG, and Recommender Systems. Currently, I'm dedicated to leveraging the power of Large Language Models to solve complex coding challenges and advance RAG technologies.
