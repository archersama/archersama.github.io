# About Me

I am an LLM Algorithm Engineer at Z.AI. Fisrst, I joined the Huawei Noah Ark Lab Recommendation and Search Laboratory in 2022 after completing my M.S. degree at Peking University. In 2025,I join Z.A I for Code LLM. My primary focus is on enhancing large language models' capabilities in code competitions and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I have also made significant contributions to LLM4Rec (Large Language Models for Recommendation) projects.  Now I focus on how to using LLM to solve real world code problem.

My research interests span LLM for Recommendation, LLM for Code, RAG, and Recommender Systems. Currently, I'm dedicated to leveraging the power of Large Language Models to solve complex coding competition and real world code problem.
